# Graph-Isomorphism-detection-implemented-by-Python
I implemented a graph related problem named 'Isomorphism detection' between two complex graphs using dividing and matching algorithm by Zeng et al.'s work [K. Zeng, X. Fan, M. Dong, and P. Yang. A fast algorithm for kinematic chain isomorphism identification based on dividing and matching vertices. Mechanism and Machine Theory, 72:25–38, 2014.]. I have implemented this project’s algorithms in Python and have used Spyder (Python 3.6 version) integrated development environment (IDE) which is pre installed in Anaconda Navigator. 


Graph Isomorphism
If two graphs are physically, but their vertices and edges aren’t same in number then it is not isomorphic. If there belongs one to one mapping function between the vertices, the relationship is called as isomorphism. Two graphs are said to be isomorphic if and only if all properties of graph isomorphism are met otherwise there won’t ne no isomorphism relationship. Properties of graph isomorphism are as follows :
• Number of vertices and edges, and parallel edges should be equal for both the graphs. 
• In degree and out degree should be equal.
• Number of connected components should be same.
• Number of loops should be same.

These are the properties for identifying if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
For the experiments, each input file contains how many graphs are being compared, the vertex numbers, edge numbers and the vertex numbers which connect an edge. For understanding the full project please read the pdf file in detail.
